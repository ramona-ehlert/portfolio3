<h3>My Education</h3>
<p>Near the beginning of the pandemic I was working in respite care. To keep everyone safe household contacts had to be limited, and I suddenly had a lot more free time on my hands. I thought that it was finally time I took coding seriously.
</p><p>
My full stack development diploma from Innotech College ensured that I was well-prepared to join the tech industry. A full time 6 month program with a focus on skills that directly translate to on the job demands. 
</p><p>
I put my best foot forward and emerged with an overall grade of 96%. I am proud of my time at school and love that in this career you never stop learning.
