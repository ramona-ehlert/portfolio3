          Tuco was my first rescue animal, and it was love at first sight.
          Though the shelter he was in would require a bit of a road trip, he
          was too cute to pass up. Six hours of mountain driving, one
          moose-related crash narrowly avoided, and $40 dollar adoption fee
          later, we would meet for the first time. He climbed into my arms with
          no hesitation, and we’ve been best friends ever since.

          Duck is our lazy little house tiger. When I saw Duck at the shelter —
          one ear, HUGE eyes, and a coat that had never seen a brush — I knew I
          had to bring her home. She’d been in the shelter for more than half
          her life, so she spent the entire first night stretching her legs —
          sprinting around the apartment, meowing with joy at the top of her
          lungs.

          Zoya is the most recent addition to the family. She is a high energy
          menace, except when it’s time for me to code. She will sit and stare
          and follow my mouse and new lines of code, and has become my web
          development sidekick recently.
