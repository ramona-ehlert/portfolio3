<h3>Why do I code?</h3>

<p>As a second generation web dev, technology has always been a part of my life. I have always had a love for creating and made many posters and photoshopped memes for my friends in high school. I am logically minded and I love problem solving.
</p><p>
I love front end development because it is the perfect mix of creativity and logical problem solving.
</p><p>
Building my career in this exciting and fast paced field has brought forth many interesting challenges that I have loved finding solutions to. I have come to learn that very little is impossible when you are passionate about the work you do.
